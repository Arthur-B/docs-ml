# The artificial neuron

In this first section, we will describe the artificial neuron and how even a single neuron can be used to learn relationships. We will start from an historical learning model, the Rosenblatt's perceptron, and move toward a gradient descent based approached.

We will start by writing code in "pure" Python and will slowly introduce PyTorch and the usual workflow to deal with neural networks.
