# Start here

## Concept

In the recent years, Machine Learning caught a lot of traction in Materials Science and Photonics.
This website is one of many approach to introduce Neural Networks to students and researchers.
It is a direct product of my experience as a PhD student in Photonics and aims to be concise, practical, and to the point.
We hope that, after following these tutorials, you will be able to build your own neural networks, apply them to your research,
 and the understand most recent papers combining Neural Networks and Photonics.

The course assume some basic understanding of Python, we will introduce [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a widely used deep learning library,
 but assume that the reader is familiar with Python and the most common scientific libraries (numpy, matplotlib, etc.).

 We will also introduce how to communicate with Lumerical softwares, most particularly [FDTD](https://www.lumerical.com/products/fdtd/), via their Python API to access meaningful data for photonic applications.
 However, since it requires licenses and may not be available, we will try to provide datasets when possible.

hi :) my name is Arthur. it is been for 5yrs that I live in South korea, not north XD. I have a girlfriend who is extremely greedy. she needs extra money extra dresses and she eats a lot.
For that she forcing me to graduate and make big money for our future(...) she is greedy, that is true. but she is also very cute. and okay cook. I think she is keeper. so for that I need a occupation.
please anybody hire me. best luck for everyone :)

 hey I am arthur's gf. he is being cranky about that I am poking his laptop which is he got from his friend almost a century ago. i think the reason why he doing this is because he doesn't have enough
 money to change his equipment... I pity him. how about anyone hires him.. okay  아이고..
 アーサーは大バカさんです。すごく優しいことは本当なんだけど、いろんな方法で大切な私を傷つけました。これからは本当に私のことだけを思ってくれたらいいなぁ…と思います。
 日本語でタイプするなんて久しぶりの気がします。悪くないですね。これからもたまたまこのような時間を入れるといいなーと思います。それまでさらば
