# Neural netoworks crash course

## Concept

This repository is a crash course in neural networks aimed to teach how to use PyTorch and build enough understanding to apply machine learning to your own projects.
The goal is to get you up and running, show some practical examples of gradual difficulty and let you apply it to your own projects. 

It compiles all the ressources I consumed during my PhD applying neural networks to material science. It is how I would have liked to learn when I started. 

It is NOT an in-depth theoritical course. There are other great online ressources or books regarding the subject. 

## Course architecture

The goal is to start small and slowly introduce new features / more complex code as we go.


## Acknowledgment

I would like to thank @myungjoon who encouraged me to swith from Tensor Flow to PyTorch and helped design the content of the course, members of @apmd-lab who experienced an early version of the course tailored to our research in nanophotonics and who gave important feedback, and Professor Jonghwa Shin for his support. 

## To-do

* Clean up the rest of the notebooks
* Build a way to display the notebooks online (website?)
* New notebook about GAN?
